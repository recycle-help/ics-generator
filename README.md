*Generate calendar (.ics) files from a simple list of dates, descriptions, and reminders*

This project aims to make it easy to generate .ics files from municipal websites which provide a calendar of trash and recycling dates for residents.  After entering relevant information, .ics file(s) will be generated which can then be added to a resident's calendar on their computer, tablet, or phone.
